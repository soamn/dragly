          <strong>
            In a world that's always online, I found others constantly plugged
            in—scrolling, refreshing, responding.
          </strong>
          <br></br> From the beginning, I made a conscious choice not to be
          swept into that current. Yet, some days, I still find myself spending
          more time on YouTube than I really need to.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          Somewhere along the way—between work, travel, and the everyday rhythm
          of adulting—I realized that’s not the version of life I want to look
          back on. I want to retire with a book in my hand, lying on green
          grass—something quieter. Something more personal.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          Books and nature have always been that quiet, loyal friend for me.
          Whether I need to reset, disconnect, learn something new, or just
          unwind, I turn to reading not just for entertainment, but for
          restoration—and most of all, for imagination.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          Readosphere is born from that personal space of my imagination—where
          stories meet self-care. It’s a place where I hope others can also find
          comfort in the pages. For anyone who believes mental well-being can be
          nurtured through stillness, wonder, and thoughtful escape—not through
          30-second stimulation—this is for you.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          This site is my way of weaving together the three things that have
          helped me most: nature, books and calm. Especially now, when life
          feels more digitized than ever, we all need a gentle reminder to pause
          and mindfully reconnect—with ourselves and with the imagination that
          move us. So, join me in curating a mindful space filled with books and
          some nature inspired writings sorts—some for reading, some for
          imagining, some for learning, and most of all, for slowing down and
          simply being.
